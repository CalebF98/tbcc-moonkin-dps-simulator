# tbcc-moonkin-dps-simulator
This repository hosts (mainly) Jupyter notebooks which simulate Moonkin DPS for WoW - The Burning Crusade Classic

At the moment, the notebooks are separated for each gear configuration. At some point, one big notebook checking all cases (including trinkets) may summarize it all.

# Todo-list :
- code each trinket
- include mana pool management
